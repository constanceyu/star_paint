# star-paint

a simple drawing tool that allows the user to draw constellations or just random drawings on a night sky.
They can place the star dusts and regular stars by clicking on the sky.
You can also choose moon and cloud setting, but be mindful that the clouds hide the starts.
That is ok though, for the clouds are temporary but the stars are everlasting.
When the sun rises and another night come, those clouds will be gone and the stars shine once more.

*Inspiration: I just wanted to do something related to stars :)*
